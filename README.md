graphicsmagick-buildpack
=========================

This project is a Scalingo [buildpack](http://doc.scalingo.com/buildpacks) to
use latest version of [GraphicsMagick](www.graphicsmagick.org) (1.3.36)
alongside your app.

It doesn't do anything else, you have to use it alongside another buildpack thanks to the [mutli-buildpack](https://github.com/Scalingo/multi-buildpack).

Usage
-----

## Setup the multi-buildpack

To use this buildpack, you should prepare `.buildpacks` file that contains this buildpack url and your real buildpack url.

```
$ cat .buildpacks
https://github.com/Scalingo/graphicsmagick-buildpack.git
https://github.com/Scalingo/ruby-buildpack.git
```

The first buildpack will install GraphicsMagick utilities in `/app/bin`, the
second will handle the deployment of your ruby application. For any other
technology, go to
[http://doc.scalingo.com/buildpacks/](http://doc.scalingo.com/buildpacks/)

## Setup your application configuration

```
$ scalingo env-set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/Scalingo/multi-buildpack.git
$ git push scalingo master
...
```

You can verify the installation of GraphicsMagick with the following command.

```
$ scalingo run "gm version"
```

## Hacking

You could upload the desired version of GraphicMagick from [GraphicMagick sources](https://hg.osdn.net/view/graphicsmagick/GM/tags)
on a S3 for example. Then using the environment variable `GRAPHICS_MAGICK_ARCHIVE_URL` to specify
the archive location, following the example:

```shell
scalingo env-set GRAPHICS_MAGICK_ARCHIVE_URL=https://hg.osdn.net/view/graphicsmagick/GM/archive/GraphicsMagick-1_3_36.tar.gz
```

> Note that Scalingo provide only support of the default version defined in `configs.sh` file.
We do not guarantee the proper functioning of the build in case of usage of other versions.

### Alternative way

To change this buildpack, fork it on Github. Push up changes to your fork,
then create a test app with `BUILDPACK_URL=<your-github-url>` and push to it.

To change the vendored binaries for ImageMagick, use the helper scripts
in the `support/` subdirectory.
You'll need an S3 account and a bucket to store your binaries in.
The bucket name and imagemagick version are stored in the configs.sh file,
so update it there (if you plan to contribute back to this repo, do this
in a separate commit).

To rebuild the GraphicsMagick package for stack 'scalingo-20', you can:

    $ docker run --rm -v $buildpack_path:/buildpack -it scalingo/scalingo-20:v1 bash
    $ apt-get install s3cmd
    $ cd /buildpack
    $ export S3_ACCESS_KEY=xxx S3_SECRET_KEY=yyy STACK=scalingo-20
    $ support/package_graphicsmagick

Commit and push the changes to your buildpack to your Github fork, then
push your sample app to Scalingo to test.  You should see:
